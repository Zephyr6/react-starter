# React Starter

I made this to avoid the extra fluff/bulk that comes along with a create-react-app ejected project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following to get things working.

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Quick Start

These instructions will get the server up and running ASAP. Once you have the Prerequisites installed, follow these instructions.

Start off by opening a terminal window in the project's root folder.

Install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Start the webpack dev server.

```
npm run start
```

The webpack dev server will refresh your page whenever you make any changes.
